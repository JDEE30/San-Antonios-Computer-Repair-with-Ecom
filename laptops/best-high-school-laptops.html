                                     </h2>
                                     <p style="font-size:larger; color: black;"> 
                                        We have tested many brands over the years and we have found that Acer makes some of the most affordable and durable laptops for pre-college or high school students. Engineering students will love this affordable laptop as it can easily run programs like unity, blender, adobe premier pro and other ram and gpu heavy programs. They are usually really easy to upgrade, they can last a very long time and in some cases, your Senior High student, can even use the same Acer laptop well into their years as a Grad student.

                                        So, as you know the computer needs of a student often cross between the needs of what's best for online schooling, and in many cases, these are also what's best for work as well. Essentially, in many cases when you're looking for the best laptop for a preparatory school, you might also be looking for the best laptop for work, for both, or also for a specific type of school such as a business school, grad school, medical school, or in some cases even elementary school. So what you are really looking for is often just a well-rounded machine that can meet all of your needs. So this third device is going to be just that.
